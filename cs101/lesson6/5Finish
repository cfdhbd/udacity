for each loop below, answer if loop always finishes, no matter what value is initally assigned.

Loop1:

n = any positive integer
i = 0
while i <= n:
  i = i + 1

this will always finish



Loop2:

n = any positive integer
i = 1
while True:
  i = i*2
  n = n+1
  if i > n:
    break

this will also always finish



Loop3:

n = any positive integer
while n != 1:
  if n % 2 == 0: #n is even
    n = n/2
  else:
    n = 3 * n + 1
